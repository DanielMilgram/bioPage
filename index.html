    About Me
    </h3>
    <h4>
        I graduated from Glenbrook North High School in the suburbs of Chicago in 2017. I am currently a freshman at the University of Illinois -Urbana Champaign pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Astronomy in the James Scholar program through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. I have always been involved in my community, whether it be the Varsity Track and Field Captain and Vice President of High Energy Physics Club in high school, to Class Social Chair at Alpha Epsilon Pi â€“ Delta Chapter and member of the Association for Computer Machinery in College

    What Motivates Me?
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Ever Since I was young I had a passion for innovating and exploring. While I was young that involved looking at planets through our telescope, going to Planetariums, reading books on the solar system, or watching Neil DeGrasse Tyson, I was always curious in what astronomy had to offer. As I grew older, I became more interested in exploring other fields, such as the field of Computer Science. The more information I learned the more intrigued I became by this profession. The field of Computer Science and Programming is constantly being modified to propel our society and technology to the future. In order to make the largest impact on our world, a profession involving Programming is the way to go. I want to be a part of the change that moves us forward.
